# Rice_Seed_Classification


This project utilizes and builds convolutional neural network architectures, followed by the application of Transfer Learning and Knowledge Distillation techniques to reduce the number of parameters.

## Dataset

Six commonly cultivated rice seed varieties in Northern Vietnam—BC-15, Hương thơm 1, Nếp-87, Q-5, Thiên ưu-8, and Xi-23—were examined. These rice seeds were sourced from a production company where the varieties were cultivated and harvested under specific conditions to meet standard rice seed production requirements. The sampling was conducted in the Thaibinh and Hanoi regions in Northern Vietnam.
